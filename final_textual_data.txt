Sentiment Analysis

What is sentiment analysis, it is primarily the way through which the emotion within a text can be interpreted and hence classified. Thus, in the machine learning terms we can say that it is a classification problem for which the output is going to be discrete values.
Here, in the case of Twitter Sentiment Analysis, we are going to analysis the text and interpret whether the emotion underlying is Positive, Negative or Neutral.

Since we are dealing with textual data,
Therefore NLP will be used for the same
Natural Language Processing (NLP): 
-> The discipline of computer science, artificial intelligence and linguistics 
-> concerned with the creation of computational models that process and understand natural language. These include: making the computer understand the semantic grouping of words (e.g. cat and dog are semantically more similar than cat and spoon), text to speech, language translation and many more.

Since we are dealing with two types of output(positive or negative )  and our data is not-skewed,
Therefore 
We will use 3 very popular Classification Algorithms:
1.BernoulliNB Model
-> Naive Bayes is a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict the probability of different classes based on numerous attributes. 
-> It indicates the likelihood of occurrence of an event. 
-> Naive Bayes is also known as conditional probability. 
-> Naive Bayes is based on the Bayes Theorem.
-> Bernoulli Naive Bayes is a part of the Naive Bayes family. It is based on the Bernoulli Distribution and accepts only binary values, i.e., 0 or 1. 
-> If the features of the dataset are binary, then we can assume that Bernoulli Naive Bayes is the algorithm to be used. 
Advantages->In case of small amount of data or small documents(for example in text classification), Bernoulli Naive Bayes gives more accurate and precise results as compared to other models.
          -> It is fast 
          -> are able to make to make real-time predictions. 
          ->It can handle irrelevant features nicely.
2.Linear Support Vector Machine Model
A support vector machine (SVM) 
-> is a supervised machine learning model based on the concept of a hyperplane
-> that uses classification algorithms 
-> for two-group classification problems.

After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, they’re able to categorize new text.

Advantages:
Compared to newer algorithms like neural networks, they have two main advantages: 
-> higher speed 
-> better performance 
-> with a limited number of samples (in the thousands). This makes the algorithm very suitable for text classification problems, where it’s common to have access to a dataset of at most a couple of thousands of tagged samples.
3.Logistic Regression Model
Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. 
The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on. 
Logistic regression makes use of the sigmoid function which outputs a probability between 0 and 1. 
The sigmoid function with some weight parameter θ and some input x^{(i)}x(i) is defined as follows:-h(x^(i), θ) = 1/(1 + e^(-θ^T*x^(i)).
The sigmoid function gives values between -1 and 1 hence we can classify the predictions depending on a particular cutoff.
