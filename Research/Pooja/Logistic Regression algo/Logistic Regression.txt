LOGISTIC REGRESSION


*** What is logistic regression?

Logistic regression is an example of supervised learning. It is used to calculate or predict the probability of a binary (yes/no) event occurring. An example of logistic regression could be applying machine learning to determine if a person is likely to be infected with COVID-19 or not.


*** Pros: ***
1. Logistic regression is easier to implement , interpret , and very efficient to train. It makes no assumption about distribution of classes in feature space.
2. It can easily extend to multiple classes(multinomial regression) and a natural probabilistic view of class prediction.
3. It not only provides a measure of how appropriate a predictor (coefficient size)is but also its direction of  association (positive or negative ).
4. Good accuracy of many simple data sets and it performs well when the dataset is linearly separable.


**Cons:**
1. If the number of observations is lesser than the number of features , Logistic Regression should not be used, otherwise , it may lead to overfitting. And It constructs linear boundaries.
2. The major limitation of Logistic Regression is the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variable.
3. It can only be used to predict discrete functions. Hence , the dependent variable of Logistic Regression is bound to the discrete number set.
4. Logistic Regression requires average or no multicollinearity between independent variables.


***Application of Logistic Algorithm:***
* In health care, logistic regression can be used to predict if a tumour is likely to be benign or malignant.
* In the financial industry, logistic regression can be used to predict if a transaction is fraudulent or not.
* In marketing, logistic regression can be used to predict if a targeted audience will respond or not.


***Types of Logistic regression***
1. Binary logistic regression - When we have two possible outcomes, like our original example of whether a person is likely to be infected with COVID-19 or not.
2. Multinomial logistic regression - When we have multiple outcomes, say if we build out our original example to predict whether someone may have the flu, an allergy, a cold, or COVID-19.
3. Ordinal logistic regression - When the outcome is ordered, like if we build out our original example to also help determine the severity of a COVID-19 infection, sorting it into mild, moderate, and severe cases.
